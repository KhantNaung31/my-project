   <h1>History Of Anthropology Department</h1> 
   <p>The Department of Anthropology in Yangon University was estabished in 1950,in Judson Hall.Its location on the campus has moved over the years:first,t0 the Social Science building,then in 1964 to Taungoo Hall.Since 1983 the Anthropology Department has been located in Yamanya Hall.The Department started small,with few staff and students but then expanded to include Sociology and even International Relations for a few years until Anthropology was reduced to a minor subject status under the new education system in 1964.At the point,the Department shrank in numbers of staff and students,until 1982 when Anthropology was restored to major subject status again.In the early years of the Department,several  overseas academics supported the teaching of Anthropology,Sociology and International Relations in Yangon,while several Myanmar academics furthered their studies in the USA and the UK Nowadays the Department is staffed by Myanmar academics.  </p>
Anthropology can be taken by Arts students as well as Science student.Science students taking Anthropology as a minor subject can earn a B.A Degree.Post-graduate students have to carry out field research and collect survey data for their Masters thesis.Following the example of the University of Yangon,in the late 1950s other intermediate colleges teaching Anthropology were opened in Myanmar:in Mawlamyine,Pathein and kyaukphyu.
Detailed History: The Department of Anthropology in Yangon University was established in 1950 under the Reactor at the time,Dr.Htin Aung,in Judson Hall.Dr.Htin Aung was also an honorary professor of the Anthropology Department,lecturing with visiting professor Dr.K.G. Orr from Chicago University.To begin with the Anthropology Department had seven first year students and three post graduate students.Daw Khin Khin Oo and Daw Khin Hmway were appointed tutors before Dr.K.G Orr left to go back to Chicago.Then the two tutors were sent on state scholarships to Chicago and Alabama Universities When Daw Khin Khin Oo and Daw Khin Hmway returned from the USA in the a/y 1952-1953,Daw Khin Khin Oo was appointed Head of the Anthropology  Department and the Department and the Department started teaching a range of classes from intermediate level,with a Masters degree introduced in 1957.

Several overseas academics taught in the Anthropology Department over the years in addition to those already mentioned.Mr.A.Sharma from New Delhi University was a full time assistance lecture 1953 to 1955,and Dr.Orshinski,a Fullbright Smithsonian scholar,lectured in 1954-1955.Dr.Burling(1959-1960),Dr.E.B. 
Banks(1960-1961)and Mr.B.A.V.Peacock(1960-1962) also worked as Anthropology lectures.
Several of the Myanmar academic staff studied for their postgraduate degrees in the United Kingdom and the United States of American on state scholarships.
From 1954 until 1959 the Department taught Sociology as well and became the Department of Sociology and Anthropology.Mr.K.W.Dunning(1957-1958),Dr.F.Nothingham (1957-1958),Dr.G Theodorson(1958-1959) and Mr.P.A.Mannis(1958-1959),all Fullbright Smithsonian scholars,taught Social Science subjects.When faculties were introduced in the University of Yangon,Anthropology and Sociology became part of 
Social Sciences.
From 1957 to 1959,Dr.Johnstone from John Hopkins Centre taught International Relations through the Anthropology Department,at Bachelor of Arts and Masters levels.In 1959-1960,International Relations moved into the Department of History.
In 1959 Sociology teaching was discontinued until the new education system started in 1964.
In 1962,staff postings within th university left only a lecture and an assistance lecturer in the Department of Anthropology.There were only 33 students taking Anthropology in 1964,with only three studying for an Anthropology Masters degree.
Under the new education system in 1964,Anthropology became just a minor subject.Only in 1982 was it restored to major subject status again.
In the newly established Anthropology Department,from 1982,Daw Nwe Nwe took over as the Head of Department.There were only twenty students in the first year class,and the same in 1983.Six teaching members of staff taught them,including the Head of Department: Daw Nwe Nwe,Daw Kyin Kyin,U Wallace Kangyi,Daw Aye Aye Myint,U Sein Htun and Daw Tin Yi.
After Daw Nwe Nwe had retired,Daw Kyin Kyin succeeded her as Head of Department,followed in her turn by U Sein Htun,then Daw Tin Yi from  1990 to 1997 when she became a professor.After Daw Tin Yi retired in 2005,U Kyaw Han succeed her,followed by Dr.Daw Mya Mya Khin.Dr.Daw Mya Mya khin has been Head of the Anthropology Dept from 2006 up until the present.
Meanwhile,in the  Hlaing Campus of the University of Yangon,the first Anthropology classes started in 1982.
U Wallence Kangyi  was the Branch Head at that time.From 1991 to 1995 U Kyaw Han served as Branches Head.
